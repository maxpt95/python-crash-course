# Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
# The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
# should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
# with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
# color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
# stored correctly.

def make_car(manufacturer, model_name, **car_features):
    car_features["manufacturer"] = manufacturer
    car_features["model_name"] = model_name
    return car_features


car = make_car("Toyota", "2000GT", power_output="White", assembly="Japan")
print(car)
